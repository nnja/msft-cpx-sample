## Running Demo Code

### Demo Code

The demo code included in this repository is optimized for the
[Device Simulator Express](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.devicesimulatorexpress&WT.mc_id=python-0000-ninaz) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=python-0000-ninaz) extension.

The extension allows you to code CircuitPython for your
CircuitPlayground Express (CPX) by testing and debugging on
the device simulator, before running your code on the actual
device.

The serial monitor easily allows you to
observe device output.

[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.devicesimulatorexpress&WT.mc_id=python-0000-ninaz) the extension to get started.

### Viewing printed output

To view printed output when the device is running, open
the command palette in Visual Studio Code and enter: `Device Simulator Express: Open Serial Monitor`

## Note: Connecting the board to Mac OS

The Circuit Playground Express (CPX) has a very tiny disk drive so we have
disabled Mac OS X indexing which could take up that valuable space.

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index
or .Trashes files!
